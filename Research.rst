Silicon photonics is a promising solution to provide low-cost and high-performance integrated photonic devices and systems. 
Currently, it is commercially driven by the increasing demand for low-cost short-range optical interconnects in data centers and the computing industry.
In the future, it might also be attractive for applications in biosensing and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). 
Our group focus on design of key passive integrated components including fiber-to-chip interface, waveguide crossings and multiplexing components 
(polarization, mode and wavelength division multiplexing). Apart from traditional design method based on intuition and 
physics, we also explore computer-automated design using advanced algorithms and deep neural networks.
